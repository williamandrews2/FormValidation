# Form Validation Project

## Introduction
A small form validation project built as part of The Odin Project curriculum. The form uses custom JavaScript validation to provide live, inline feedback as the user fills it out. A live preview can be found [here](https://williamandrews2.github.io/FormValidation/).

## Features
- Live inline validation for:
  * Email
  * Country
  * Postal Code
  * Password
  * Password Confirmation
- Fields are highlighted in red with error messages until valid
- Form uses novalidate to disable native browser validation
- JavaScript handles all validation logic
- Displays a success message (aka a "high five") when the form is correctly filled
- Error shown if form is submitted with invalid or empty fields
- Styled using CSS with :valid and :invalid pseudo-classes
